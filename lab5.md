# Lab Report 5

Reflection

Overall, I think this class has taught me a lot when it comes to using terminal. Even though i knew some basic commands I did not know what most of them meant and how I would fix certain errors. Most of the time I would just look up online commands or just prefer to do things outside the terminal but this class taught me to explore and learn terminal commands. Some new ones include ```grep``` and ```vim```.
