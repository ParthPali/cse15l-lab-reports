For this step, I typed in the ```ssh ppaliwal@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` command and then pressed ```<Enter>``` to ssh into my ieng6 server.

## Step 5

This clones my forked lab7 repository into my ieng6 home directory. To do this I first typed the command ```git clone https://github.com/parthpali/lab7``` and then pressed ```<Enter> ```  


## Step 6

Here are the keys pressed: 
```cd lab7 <Enter>```
```<up>```

I did ```cd lab7``` to go into the lab7 directory. Then I pressed ```<up>``` 12 times to get to the ```javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java``` line which compiles all the java files. 
Finally pressed ```<up>``` 12 times to get to the ```java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests```, which runs the tester file. 

## Step 7

Commands used:
```vim ListExamples.java``` 
```<enter>```
```43```
```e```
```r2```
```:wq```

I used the vim command to open ```ListExamples.java``` in the vim editor. 
I used ```43``` and ```<enter>``` to jump to 43rd line. 
I used ```e``` to get to the end of the word and ```r2``` to replace correct the error. 
Finally I pressed ```:wq``` and ```<enter>``` to save my changes and exit out of the vim.

Key pressed: 
```<up>``` 
```<enter>```

I clicked ```<up>``` 6 times to get to the ```javac -cp.:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java``` command then pressed ```<enter>```. Then I repeated that but instead to run the ```java -cp.:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests``` command. 

## Step 9

I pressed ```git add ListExamples.java <enter>```, ```git commit -m "update list examples file"```, ```<enter>```, ```git push```. This adds the changes from ```ListExamples.java```, stages those changes, commits those changes with the commit message, and then pushes it to the repository.
